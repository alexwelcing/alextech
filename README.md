# Using Next.JS and Netlify for performative and compartmentalized site.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v9.5.4 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and set up to be instantly deployed to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/Bk4UicocL)! Original work done by Netlify Principal Engineer [Cassidoo](https://github.com/cassidoo).

This project starts w/ 2 sample components, API endpoint,`netlify.toml` for deployment, and a `jsconfig.json` for setting up absolute imports and aliases.

## Setup

1st, install project:

``` bash
yarn
```

2nd, run the development server:
```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
